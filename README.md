# UFOs

## Project Overview

The project consists on crating a Javascript file to hold in the functions that will be running within an HTML file, that will be the display we will see happenning in the web explorer. 
The functions are all realted to holding a database and filtering it in order to make it more manageable for the final users.

### Results

> UFOs sightings
> We managed to create a table with a database of all the UFO sightings in the US, and by using a set of tools JS, HTML, CSS making it easier for the users to explore, filter and look up for information in our web site.
> We learned about the structure of a HTML code. How it behaves, how it is orders, sizes, columns segmentatios, classes, linking an JS file to call the functions, adding color and images, buttons and filters.

> Conclusions

- Web pages can be as dynamic as we want
- HTML same as Jupyter can import libraries with different functions
- JS and HTML are used to interact and create one solid structure with functions. 
- We can add data tables to our HTML files, so anyone can look for resources online.
